# YFA - youtube feed aggregator

If you have multiple youtube accounts and wish to aggregate all their feeds visually into one place, this is a good solution for you

## Requirements, setup

You only need docker, if you wish to run this locally. I recommend installing docker-desktop (windows).

Simply execute the [docker_compose_start.cmd](docker_compose_start.cmd) file!

^If you wish to host it somewhere, build the project and use the output (dist)!
